"""
config.py
=========

This file is used to store configuration variables for the robot. This is
benefial as it enables us to decouple logic from robot-specific variables,
like the port a particular motor is attached to.

General tip: In the heat of the competition you will probably find yourself
tweaking command/subsystem files themselves (e.g. "Oh nooo it's too fast wtf
slow it down hury hurry before the next match!!!"). This is to be expected, and
is FINE -- as long as you remember to go back after competition and clean up
all the code.
